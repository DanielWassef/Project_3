POINT 1:
I have tried to add as i can understand.
POINT 2:

POINT 3&4:
I don't understand how to fix this issue and i need your help please: 
You will find in screen shots a series of Question screenshot related to this part
After investigating i found that the used API to add employee is wrongly built using a strange backend ip !!!
As in screenshot 1-A  API IP is 3.85.238.248 but my Backend machine ip is 3.87.161.18 as per screenshot 1-D
Also you will find that right IP is stored to frontend/.env as per same screenshot 1-D
1-C show that port 3030 is open and listening and i can telnet it from my local machine
In 1-B i found part in code that may be responsible for building this API URL but i have no idea how to trace it
In 1-E i tried to post to the backend ip and it was successfully accessible but of course not working as i didn't add the required parameters but it did respond
********Thanks to guide me plz******
POINT 5:
Done
Regarding the S3 Bucket website is not reachable: I don't know where is the issue even me i can't access files from bucket it self i can see them when i try to open index.html it can resolve the welcome title but nothing else !!!
